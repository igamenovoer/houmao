# houmao-mgr agents mail

Managed-agent mailbox discovery and follow-up commands. `houmao-mgr` routes ordinary mailbox actions through pair-owned gateway-backed execution, local manager-owned direct execution when available, or local live-TUI submission fallback when direct authority is unavailable. The dedicated operator-origin `post` action is stricter: it requires authoritative gateway-backed or manager-owned execution and never falls back to TUI submission.

This is the **operator-facing CLI** for ordinary mailbox follow-up. The matching **agent-facing skill surface** is now unified into two packaged Houmao skills:

- `houmao-agent-email-comms` — ordinary shared-mailbox operations and the no-gateway fallback path. This is the canonical mailbox-operations skill paired with the `agents mail` family below.
- `houmao-process-emails-via-gateway` — round-oriented workflow for processing notifier-driven unread shared-mailbox emails through a prompt-provided gateway base URL.

For the narrative tour of every packaged system skill, see the [System Skills Overview](../../getting-started/system-skills-overview.md).

```
houmao-mgr agents mail [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
```

## Targeting Rules

- `--agent-id` or `--agent-name` explicitly selects one managed agent.
- Inside the owning managed tmux session, omitting both selectors resolves the current session through `HOUMAO_MANIFEST_PATH` first and `HOUMAO_AGENT_ID` plus shared-registry metadata second.
- Outside tmux, omitting both selectors fails explicitly instead of guessing from cwd or ambient shell state.
- `--port` is only supported with an explicit `--agent-id` or `--agent-name` target.

## Commands

### `resolve-live`

Resolve the current mailbox bindings and optional live gateway metadata for one managed agent.

```
houmao-mgr agents mail resolve-live [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--port INTEGER` | Houmao pair authority port to use with an explicit selector. |
| `--agent-id TEXT` | Authoritative managed-agent id. |
| `--agent-name TEXT` | Raw creation-time friendly managed-agent name. Do not include the `HOUMAO-` prefix. |

JSON output includes the resolved mailbox binding, a `managed_agent` summary, `gateway_available`, and optional `gateway` metadata including `base_url` when a live shared `/v1/mail/*` facade is available. The transport-specific mailbox details live under `mailbox.filesystem.*` or `mailbox.stalwart.*`. Mailbox-specific shell export is not part of the supported `resolve-live` contract.

### `status`

| `--agent-name TEXT` | Raw creation-time friendly managed-agent name. |

### `read`

Read one mailbox message and mark it read.

```
houmao-mgr agents mail read [OPTIONS]
```

### `send`

Send one mailbox message for a managed agent.

```
houmao-mgr agents mail send [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--to TEXT` | Recipient address. Required and repeatable. |
| `--cc TEXT` | CC recipient address. Repeatable. |
| `--subject TEXT` | Message subject. Required. |

| `--attach TEXT` | Attachment file path. Repeatable. |
| `--notify-block TEXT` | Sender-marked notification block; capped at 512 chars. When omitted, the body is scanned for the first ` ```houmao-notify ` fenced block. See [Notification-prompt block](#notification-prompt-block). |
| `--port INTEGER` | Houmao pair authority port to use with an explicit selector. |
| `--agent-id TEXT` | Authoritative managed-agent id. |
| `--agent-name TEXT` | Raw creation-time friendly managed-agent name. |

### `post`

Post one operator-origin mailbox note into a managed agent inbox.

```
houmao-mgr agents mail post [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|

`post` is filesystem-only in v1. It delivers from the reserved Houmao-owned sender `HOUMAO-operator@houmao.localhost` into the selected managed agent mailbox and marks the message as operator-origin with explicit reply policy metadata. The default `reply_policy=operator_mailbox` allows replies to that specific operator-origin message back to the reserved operator mailbox. `reply_policy=none` is the explicit no-reply opt-out for one-way operator-origin notes. This action does not allow TUI submission fallback.

### `reply`

Reply to one mailbox message for a managed agent.

```
houmao-mgr agents mail reply [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--message-ref TEXT` | Opaque message reference returned by `agents mail list`. Required. |
| `--body-content TEXT` | Inline body content. |
| `--body-file TEXT` | Body content file path. |
| `--attach TEXT` | Attachment file path. Repeatable. |
| `--port INTEGER` | Houmao pair authority port to use with an explicit selector. |
| `--agent-id TEXT` | Authoritative managed-agent id. |
| `--agent-name TEXT` | Raw creation-time friendly managed-agent name. |

Replies to operator-origin parent messages succeed when the parent was posted with `reply_policy=operator_mailbox`, which is the default for new operator-origin posts. When the parent explicitly used `reply_policy=none`, reply is rejected explicitly.

## Result Semantics

- Verified pair-owned and manager-owned execution returns `authoritative: true`, `status: "verified"`, and `execution_path: "gateway_backed"` or `"manager_direct"`.
- Local live-TUI fallback returns `authoritative: false` with submission-only status such as `submitted`, `rejected`, `busy`, `interrupted`, or `tui_error`.
- `post` never returns a TUI-submission result because it refuses non-authoritative execution.
- Non-authoritative fallback results may include `preview_result`, but callers must verify outcome through manager-owned follow-up such as `agents mail status` or `agents mail list`, the live gateway `/v1/mail/*` state, filesystem mailbox inspection, or transport-native mailbox state.

## Notification-prompt block

`send` and `post` carry an optional `notify_block` string in the canonical mailbox envelope, intended for prominent receiver-side rendering by future notification surfaces. There are two authoring paths:

**Body fence (default authoring path)** — write a Markdown fenced code block with info-string `houmao-notify` inside `--body-content` (or the file passed to `--body-file`). The first such fence is extracted into the canonical `notify_block` field at composition time. The fence text remains in the body source so receivers reading the full message see the same content.

```bash
pixi run houmao-mgr agents mail send \
  --agent-name alice \
  --to bob@houmao.localhost \
  --subject "bench results" \
  --body-content $'see attached numbers.\n\n```houmao-notify\nIf speedup ≥ 50x, re-run on official timing path before reporting.\n```'
```

**Explicit `--notify-block` flag** — supply the value out of band. The CLI uses the explicit value directly; body-fence extraction is bypassed.

```bash
pixi run houmao-mgr agents mail post \
  --agent-name alice \
  --subject "Continue current task" \
  --body-content "Operator note from supervisor." \
  --notify-block "continue current task"
```

Constraints to know:

- Maximum extracted block length is 512 characters; longer values are truncated to 511 characters plus a trailing `…`.
- When the body contains more than one `houmao-notify` fence, only the first is extracted; later fences remain in the body but are not added to `notify_block`.
- An empty fence produces no `notify_block` (treated as absent rather than an empty string).
- Stalwart-bound mailbox sends currently reject `notify_block`; the JMAP-side projection lands in a follow-on change.

In this protocol version, gateway notifier prompts do not yet render `notify_block`; the field is stored in the canonical envelope and surfaces in the receiver's notification context only after the follow-on rendering change ships verifiers and template slots.

## Examples

```bash
# Resolve the current session's live mailbox binding from inside the owning tmux session.
pixi run houmao-mgr agents mail resolve-live

# Leave one operator-origin note in the current managed agent mailbox.
pixi run houmao-mgr agents mail post \
  --agent-name research \
  --subject "Resume after sync" \
  --body-content "Continue from the latest mailbox checkpoint."

# Archive one processed message for an explicit target.
pixi run houmao-mgr agents mail archive \
  --agent-name research \
  --message-ref filesystem:msg-20260312T050000Z-parent
```
