## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Mailbox internal documentation explains runtime integration and mutable-state architecture
The mailbox internal documentation SHALL explain how the runtime integrates mailbox support and how the filesystem transport divides immutable content from mutable state.

At minimum, that internal coverage SHALL include:

- primary runtime-owned mailbox skill projection under `skills/mailbox/...`,
- mailbox binding refresh behavior,
- mailbox-local rules and managed helper interaction points,
- SQLite responsibility boundaries,
- address-scoped locking behavior for mailbox mutation flows.

#### Scenario: Internal docs explain runtime integration
- **WHEN** a maintainer needs to understand how mailbox support is attached to runtime sessions
- **THEN** the mailbox internals pages explain the primary discoverable mailbox skill projection under `skills/mailbox/...`, the env binding model, and mailbox command integration points
- **AND THEN** the reader can relate the mailbox reference to the runtime integration code paths
- **AND THEN** the explanation gives enough plain-language framing that a developer new to the mailbox subsystem can follow the architecture

#### Scenario: Internal docs explain mutable-state and locking responsibilities
- **WHEN** a maintainer needs to understand mailbox mutation safety and state ownership
- **THEN** the mailbox internals pages explain the split between immutable canonical messages, mutable SQLite-backed mailbox state, and address-scoped locking behavior
- **AND THEN** the documentation makes clear which mailbox artifacts are authoritative for each responsibility
