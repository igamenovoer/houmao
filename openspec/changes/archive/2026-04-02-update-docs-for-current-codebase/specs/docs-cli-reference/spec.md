## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: CLI reference stubs completed for all agents subcommand pages

The CLI reference SHALL complete all truncated stub pages for `houmao-mgr agents` subcommand families. Specifically:

- `docs/reference/cli/agents-gateway.md` SHALL document all subcommands including the `tui` subgroup (`state`, `history`, `watch`, `note-prompt`) and the `mail-notifier` subgroup (`status`, `enable`, `disable`) with full option tables.
- `docs/reference/cli/agents-mail.md` SHALL document all subcommands (`resolve-live`, `status`, `check`, `send`, `reply`, `mark-read`) with full option tables and usage notes.
- `docs/reference/cli/agents-mailbox.md` SHALL document all subcommands (`register`, `unregister`, `status`) with full option tables.
- `docs/reference/cli/agents-turn.md` SHALL document all subcommands (`submit`, `status`, `events`, `stdout`, `stderr`) with full option tables.

Each completed page SHALL follow the style of `docs/reference/cli/admin-cleanup.md`: hand-written prose with option tables, brief usage context, and example commands where helpful.

#### Scenario: agents-gateway page covers tui and mail-notifier subgroups

- **WHEN** a reader opens `docs/reference/cli/agents-gateway.md`
- **THEN** they find complete documentation for `attach`, `detach`, `status`, `prompt`, `interrupt`, `send-keys`
- **AND THEN** they find complete documentation for `tui state`, `tui history`, `tui watch`, `tui note-prompt`
- **AND THEN** they find complete documentation for `mail-notifier status`, `mail-notifier enable`, `mail-notifier disable`

#### Scenario: agents-mail page covers all commands with targeting rules

- **WHEN** a reader opens `docs/reference/cli/agents-mail.md`
- **THEN** they find complete documentation for all 6 subcommands with option tables
- **AND THEN** the page is not truncated mid-content

#### Scenario: agents-turn page covers stdout and stderr commands

- **WHEN** a reader opens `docs/reference/cli/agents-turn.md`
- **THEN** they find complete documentation for `submit`, `status`, `events`, `stdout`, and `stderr` with option tables
- **AND THEN** the page is not truncated mid-content

### Requirement: houmao-passive-server reference rewritten with operational depth

The CLI reference page `docs/reference/cli/houmao-passive-server.md` SHALL be rewritten from the current 30-line stub to a comprehensive reference covering:

- When to use passive-server vs houmao-server: a comparison table showing that passive-server is stateless/registry-driven with no child process supervision, while houmao-server provides full session management.
- API contract: the routes and capabilities available through the passive-server REST API.
- Operational guidance: how to start, configure, and use the passive-server in a distributed agent coordination setup.
- The `serve` command with all current options.

#### Scenario: Reader understands when to use passive-server

- **WHEN** a reader opens the houmao-passive-server reference
- **THEN** they find a comparison table or section explaining passive-server vs houmao-server trade-offs
- **AND THEN** they can make an informed decision about which server to deploy

#### Scenario: passive-server API surface documented

- **WHEN** a reader needs to integrate with the passive-server
- **THEN** the page documents the available REST routes and their response contracts
- **AND THEN** the page notes which `houmao-mgr` commands are compatible with the passive-server

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: houmao-mgr reference documents all command groups

The CLI reference SHALL include a page for `houmao-mgr` documenting its active command groups (`admin`, `agents`, `brains`, `mailbox`, `project`, and `server`) with subcommand summaries derived from `srv_ctrl/commands/` module docstrings, Click decorators, and live help output.

The CLI reference SHALL make the major nested managed-agent and project command families discoverable either inline or through dedicated linked pages. At minimum, that coverage SHALL include:

- `agents launch`, `join`, `list`, `state`, `prompt`, `stop`, `interrupt`, and `relaunch`,
- `agents turn`,
- `agents gateway` (including `tui` and `mail-notifier` subgroups),
- `agents mail`,
- `agents mailbox`,
- `agents cleanup`,
- `project agents`,
- `project easy`,
- `project mailbox`,
- `admin cleanup`.

When the CLI reference documents `agents mail`, that coverage SHALL include the current subcommands `resolve-live`, `status`, `check`, `send`, `reply`, and `mark-read`, and it SHALL explain:

- the selector rules for explicit targeting versus current-session targeting inside the owning managed tmux session,
- the structured `resolve-live` result contract for current mailbox discovery, including the returned mailbox binding and optional `gateway.base_url`,
- that mailbox-specific shell export is not part of the supported `resolve-live` contract,
- the authority-aware result semantics that distinguish verified execution from non-authoritative TUI submission fallback.

When the CLI reference documents `agents gateway`, that coverage SHALL include the `tui` subgroup (`state`, `history`, `watch`, `note-prompt`) and the `mail-notifier` subgroup (`status`, `enable`, `disable`) with full option tables and descriptions.

The `brains build` options table in the CLI reference SHALL reflect the current live CLI flag names: `--preset`, `--setup`, and `--auth`. The table SHALL NOT list retired flag names `--recipe`, `--config-profile`, or `--cred-profile`.

#### Scenario: Reader finds current agent lifecycle and project command groups
- **WHEN** a reader looks up `houmao-mgr`
- **THEN** they find documented subcommands for `agents`, `brains`, `mailbox`, `project`, `server`, and `admin`
- **AND THEN** the CLI reference does not present removed or outdated project group names such as `agent-tools` as the supported public project surface

#### Scenario: Reader can discover nested managed-agent and project command families
- **WHEN** a reader needs details for `agents gateway`, `agents turn`, `agents mail`, `agents mailbox`, `project agents`, `project easy`, `project mailbox`, or `admin cleanup`
- **THEN** the CLI reference provides a direct path to formal reference coverage for those nested families
- **AND THEN** the reader does not need to reconstruct those command surfaces only from source code or scattered prose pages

#### Scenario: Reader can find `agents mail resolve-live` and targeting rules
- **WHEN** a reader looks up `houmao-mgr agents mail`
- **THEN** the CLI reference documents `resolve-live`, `mark-read`, and the other mailbox follow-up commands in that family
- **AND THEN** the reader can see when omitted selectors resolve the current managed tmux session and when explicit `--agent-id` or `--agent-name` is required
- **AND THEN** the page explains that `resolve-live` returns structured mailbox data rather than mailbox-specific shell export

#### Scenario: Reader can find `agents mail` result-strength guidance
- **WHEN** a reader looks up `houmao-mgr agents mail` result behavior
- **THEN** the CLI reference explains when the command returns verified authoritative results versus non-authoritative submission-only fallback
- **AND THEN** the page points the reader to the supported verification paths for non-authoritative outcomes

#### Scenario: Reader finds brain management commands
- **WHEN** a reader looks up `houmao-mgr brains`
- **THEN** they find documented subcommands for load, list, and build operations

#### Scenario: Reader finds correct brains build flag names
- **WHEN** a reader looks up `houmao-mgr brains build` options in the CLI reference
- **THEN** the options table lists `--preset`, `--setup`, and `--auth`
- **AND THEN** the table does NOT list `--recipe`, `--config-profile`, or `--cred-profile`

#### Scenario: Example commands in paired reference docs use current flag names
- **WHEN** a reader copies a `houmao-mgr brains build` example command from any docs page
- **THEN** the command uses `--setup` and `--auth` instead of `--config-profile` and `--cred-profile`
- **AND THEN** the command does not fail with an unrecognized option error

#### Scenario: Reader finds gateway tui and mail-notifier subgroups documented
- **WHEN** a reader looks up `houmao-mgr agents gateway`
- **THEN** the CLI reference includes `tui state`, `tui history`, `tui watch`, `tui note-prompt` with option tables
- **AND THEN** the CLI reference includes `mail-notifier status`, `mail-notifier enable`, `mail-notifier disable` with option tables
