## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: `houmao-mailbox-mgr` resolves the `houmao-mgr` launcher in the required precedence order
The packaged `houmao-mailbox-mgr` skill SHALL instruct agents to resolve the `houmao-mgr` launcher for the current workspace using this default order unless the user explicitly requests a different launcher:

1. resolve `houmao-mgr` with `command -v houmao-mgr` and use the command found on `PATH`,
2. if that lookup fails, use the uv-managed fallback `uv tool run --from houmao houmao-mgr`,
3. if the PATH lookup and uv-managed fallback do not satisfy the turn, choose an appropriate development launcher such as `pixi run houmao-mgr`, repo-local `.venv/bin/houmao-mgr`, or project-local `uv run houmao-mgr`.

The skill SHALL treat the `command -v houmao-mgr` result as the ordinary first-choice launcher for the current turn.

The skill SHALL treat the uv-managed fallback as the ordinary non-PATH fallback because Houmao's documented installation path uses uv tools.

The skill SHALL only probe development-project hints such as `.venv`, Pixi files, `pyproject.toml`, or `uv.lock` after PATH resolution and uv fallback do not satisfy the turn, unless the user explicitly asks for a development launcher.

The skill SHALL honor an explicit user instruction to use a specific launcher family even when a higher-priority default launcher is available.

The resolved launcher SHALL be reused for any routed mailbox-admin action selected through the packaged skill.

#### Scenario: PATH launcher is preferred before development probing
- **WHEN** `command -v houmao-mgr` succeeds in the current workspace
- **THEN** the skill tells the agent to use that PATH-resolved `houmao-mgr` command for the turn
- **AND THEN** it does not probe `.venv`, Pixi, or project-local uv launchers first

#### Scenario: uv fallback is used when PATH lookup fails
- **WHEN** `command -v houmao-mgr` fails in the current workspace
- **THEN** the skill tells the agent to try `uv tool run --from houmao houmao-mgr`
- **AND THEN** it treats that uv-managed launcher as the ordinary next fallback because Houmao is officially installed through uv tools

#### Scenario: Development launchers are later defaults, not first probes
- **WHEN** `command -v houmao-mgr` fails
- **AND WHEN** the uv-managed fallback does not satisfy the turn
- **AND WHEN** the current workspace provides development launchers such as Pixi, repo-local `.venv`, or project-local uv
- **THEN** the skill tells the agent to choose an appropriate development launcher for that workspace
- **AND THEN** it does not treat those development launchers as the default first search path

#### Scenario: Explicit user launcher choice overrides the default order
- **WHEN** the user explicitly asks to use `pixi run houmao-mgr`, repo-local `.venv/bin/houmao-mgr`, project-local `uv run houmao-mgr`, or another specific launcher
- **THEN** the skill tells the agent to honor that requested launcher
- **AND THEN** it does not replace the user-requested launcher with the default PATH-first or uv-fallback choice
