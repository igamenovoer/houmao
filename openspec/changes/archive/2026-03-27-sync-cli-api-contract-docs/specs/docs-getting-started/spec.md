## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Architecture overview explains two-phase lifecycle

The getting-started section SHALL include an architecture overview document that explains the two-phase lifecycle (build phase → run phase), the agent definition directory model, the backend abstraction, and the current operator-facing CLI surfaces. The content SHALL be derived from `brain_builder.py`, `realm_controller/`, and the current `houmao-mgr` and `houmao-server` command trees.

#### Scenario: Reader understands build-then-run flow

- **WHEN** a reader opens the architecture overview
- **THEN** they find a clear explanation of: (1) build phase producing a BrainManifest from a recipe or blueprint, (2) run phase composing manifest plus role into a LaunchPlan dispatched to a backend, and (3) `houmao-mgr` as the primary operator CLI for the supported workflow

#### Scenario: Backend model presented with current operator posture

- **WHEN** the architecture overview describes backends and entrypoints
- **THEN** `local_interactive` is presented as the primary backend, native headless backends are presented as direct CLI alternatives, and CAO-backed backends are described only as legacy or compatibility paths
- **AND THEN** the overview does not present deprecated or compatibility entrypoints as the primary way to operate Houmao

### Requirement: Quickstart guide covers build and launch

The getting-started section SHALL include a quickstart page showing how to build a brain home and start, prompt, and stop a session using the current `houmao-mgr` managed-agent workflow, derived from the CLI command groups in `srv_ctrl/commands/`.

The quickstart SHALL:

- use `houmao-mgr brains build` when teaching build-phase concepts,
- use `houmao-mgr agents launch --agents <selector> --agent-name <name>` for the primary managed launch path,
- show follow-up control targeted by `--agent-name` or `--agent-id`,
- use `houmao-mgr agents stop` for shutdown,
- avoid presenting `--manifest`, `--session-id`, or `agents terminate` as the primary `houmao-mgr` workflow.

#### Scenario: Quickstart uses current managed-agent selectors

- **WHEN** a reader follows the quickstart command examples
- **THEN** the page shows `houmao-mgr` commands that target managed agents with `--agents`, `--agent-name`, or `--agent-id`
- **AND THEN** the page does not instruct the reader to use `--session-id` for the main managed-agent flow

#### Scenario: Quickstart uses current stop command

- **WHEN** a reader reaches the shutdown step
- **THEN** the page documents `houmao-mgr agents stop`
- **AND THEN** the page does not describe `houmao-mgr agents terminate` as the supported shutdown command
