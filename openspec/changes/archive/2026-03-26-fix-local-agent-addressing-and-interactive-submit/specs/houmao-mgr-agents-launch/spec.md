## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: `houmao-mgr agents launch` accepts user-specified agent identity fields

`houmao-mgr agents launch` SHALL accept user-specified managed-agent identity inputs for launch-time publication.

At minimum:

- `--agent-name <name>` SHALL be required
- `--agent-id <id>` SHALL be optional

When the caller omits `--agent-id`, the launch path SHALL derive the effective authoritative identity as `md5(agent_name).hexdigest()`.

The launch path SHALL validate both `agent_name` and `agent_id` against the shared registry's filesystem-safe and URL-safe identity rules before publishing the live record.

#### Scenario: Launch accepts explicit friendly name and authoritative id

- **WHEN** an operator runs `houmao-mgr agents launch --agents projection-demo --provider codex --agent-name gpu --agent-id gpu-prod-001 --yolo`
- **THEN** the launch path publishes the managed agent with friendly name `gpu` and authoritative id `gpu-prod-001`
- **AND THEN** later exact control may target that agent by `--agent-id gpu-prod-001`

#### Scenario: Launch derives authoritative id when omitted

- **WHEN** an operator runs `houmao-mgr agents launch --agents projection-demo --provider codex --agent-name gpu --yolo`
- **THEN** the launch path derives the effective authoritative identity as `md5("gpu").hexdigest()`
- **AND THEN** the published live record uses that derived value as `agent_id`

### Requirement: `houmao-mgr agents launch` reports managed-agent and tmux identities separately

When `houmao-mgr agents launch` completes successfully, the command SHALL report the managed-agent identity fields separately from the tmux session handle used to host the live terminal surface.

At minimum, the successful launch output SHALL surface:

- the required `agent_name` for later `houmao-mgr agents ...` commands
- the authoritative `agent_id`
- the actual `tmux_session_name`
- the `manifest_path`

When the operator supplied `--session-name`, that value SHALL remain the tmux session handle only unless it independently matches the chosen managed-agent name by coincidence. The launch output SHALL make that distinction visible to the operator.

When the operator did not supply `agent_id`, the launch path SHALL surface the effective derived `agent_id` used for publication and later exact addressing.

#### Scenario: Interactive launch prints control ref and tmux session distinctly

- **WHEN** an operator runs `houmao-mgr agents launch --agents projection-demo --provider codex --session-name hm-gw-track-codex --yolo`
- **THEN** the successful launch output includes the effective `agent_name`, the authoritative `agent_id`, the tmux session name `hm-gw-track-codex`, and the manifest path
- **AND THEN** the output makes clear which value to use for later managed-agent commands versus tmux attach operations

#### Scenario: Custom session name does not redefine the managed-agent ref

- **WHEN** an operator launches a managed agent with `--session-name my-custom-tmux-name`
- **AND WHEN** the runtime publishes a different managed-agent name in the shared registry
- **THEN** the launch output shows both values distinctly
- **AND THEN** `my-custom-tmux-name` is not implied to have replaced the managed-agent name

#### Scenario: Omitted agent id reports the derived effective identity

- **WHEN** an operator launches a managed agent without supplying `agent_id`
- **THEN** the launch output includes the effective `agent_id = md5(agent_name).hexdigest()`
- **AND THEN** the operator can use that derived `agent_id` for later exact disambiguation if needed
