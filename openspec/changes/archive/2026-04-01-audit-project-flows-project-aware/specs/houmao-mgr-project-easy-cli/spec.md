## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: `project easy specialist list/get/remove` resolve project state without bootstrapping
Maintained `houmao-mgr project easy specialist list`, `get`, and `remove` flows SHALL resolve the active overlay through the shared non-creating project-aware resolver.

When no active project overlay exists for the caller and no stronger overlay selection override applies, these commands SHALL fail clearly without bootstrapping a new overlay.

`project easy specialist remove` SHALL remain non-creating even though it mutates existing specialist state.

#### Scenario: Specialist list fails clearly when no overlay exists
- **WHEN** no active project overlay exists
- **AND WHEN** an operator runs `houmao-mgr project easy specialist list`
- **THEN** the command fails clearly because no project overlay was discovered for the current invocation
- **AND THEN** it does not create `<cwd>/.houmao` only to return an empty specialist list

#### Scenario: Specialist remove does not bootstrap an empty overlay
- **WHEN** no active project overlay exists
- **AND WHEN** an operator runs `houmao-mgr project easy specialist remove --name researcher`
- **THEN** the command fails clearly before attempting specialist removal
- **AND THEN** it does not create a new project overlay as a side effect of that remove command

### Requirement: `project easy instance list/get/stop` resolve project state without bootstrapping
Maintained `houmao-mgr project easy instance list`, `get`, and `stop` flows SHALL resolve the active overlay through the shared non-creating project-aware resolver before inspecting runtime state or verifying overlay ownership.

When no active project overlay exists for the caller and no stronger overlay selection override applies, these commands SHALL fail clearly without bootstrapping a new overlay.

#### Scenario: Instance list fails clearly when no overlay exists
- **WHEN** no active project overlay exists
- **AND WHEN** an operator runs `houmao-mgr project easy instance list`
- **THEN** the command fails clearly because no project overlay was discovered for the current invocation
- **AND THEN** it does not create `<cwd>/.houmao` as a side effect of that inspection command

#### Scenario: Instance stop does not bootstrap before checking ownership
- **WHEN** no active project overlay exists
- **AND WHEN** an operator runs `houmao-mgr project easy instance stop --name repo-research-1`
- **THEN** the command fails clearly before attempting runtime ownership verification or stop delegation
- **AND THEN** it does not create a new project overlay only to reject or stop an existing instance
